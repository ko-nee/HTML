        <h2>I'm ready to learn HTML</h2>
        <p>This is my first web page. Headings have a hierarchy. Making h2 a subtopic heading, lower than h1 but higher than h3 below.</p>

        <p>these horizontals rules less than h-r greater than, create a margin dividing sections between different paragraphs. Like different articles on a news site </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>The next subtopic, under the main topic gives everything semantic meaning</h3>
        <p>we can also make a number of points, nesting them inside other paragraphs. let me show you how:
            <br>... we add a line break with b and r 
            <br>... the 3 dots are not required, just for example
            <br>...we are showing each of these details on separate lines
            </p>
        </section>

        <hr>
        <section id="html2">
        <h2>Now we are learning about new elements</h2>
        <p>The elements are blockline elements and inline elements. e-m, <em>called emphasis which is really italics,</em>  and strong <strong>has a really bolding effect</strong></p>
        <p>Whilst the header and paragraph we've been working with are block level elements</p>
        </section>

        <h3>Formatting the layout, the non-CSS way</h3>
            <p>
                there are grammar symbols that html recognises as a technical element. The ampersand & help the program to read it whatever follows into it's symbol state. Example:
                <br>&nbsp;... which creates white space. watch this:
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indenting nicely
            </p>
            <p>
                What can we do for greater than and less than?
                &lt;&lt;&lt;&copy;<a href="about.html">Kone Mas</a> &gt;&gt;&gt;
                <br> lt mean less than, gt means greater than, and copy makes the copyright symbol.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's how to create a tool tip.
                I've heard good things about mousing over an <abbr title="abbreviation">abb</abbr> or some kind of <abbr title="shortened">txt</abbr> word
            </p>
            <p>we can also do it with information of a location:
                <address>
                    Plot 82 Leeuwkuil<br>
                    Polokwane<br>
                    0700
                    with a location <a href="https://banabatau-agricultural-co-operative-ltd.business.site/">si,la!</a> 
                </address>
 
                <p>
                    We can also add comments, that don't show on the page although it can be visible in the source code by the public. <!-- you add the comment here -->
                </p>
            <h3>Now we are going to deal with creating lists: order and unordered!</h3>
                <p>This is the example on ordered lists:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>... this will number</li>
                        <li>... everything we write in here</li>
                        <li>...automatically giving it some order. I hope css will help me out</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>This is the example on unordered lists:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>... We can actually nest paragraphs inside the list items and it will be indented neatly</li> 
                    <li>... We just l and i at the beginning and end of each point </li>
                    <li>...and the system will automatically add in bullets for order.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Now we are going to deal with description lists</h3>
                <dl>Here there are two different types of elements:
                    
                    <dt>Description term</dt>
                    <dd>Description details</dd>

                    <dt>This will be start right at the beginning of the line</dt>
                    <dd>this will be slightly indented to start on the right a bit</dd>

                </dl>
                <ol>... Instead of nesting the points between a paragraph</ol> 
                <ol>... We just oh and el at the beginning and end of each point </ol>
                <ol>...and the system will automatically add in the numbers for order.
                </ol>
